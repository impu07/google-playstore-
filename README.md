A mobile app development team wants to gain insights into app ratings and 
reviews on the Google Play Store to inform their development strategy. They 
aim to understand how different app categories perform in terms of user ratings, 
identify potential areas for improvement, and explore any patterns that could 
influence the development of their next app.
